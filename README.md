## 🏆 The challenge
The challenge was to build a design system using Figma to create the design standards and Storybook to create the documentation. After that, build components with React creating and the style with Tailwind.

Users should be able to:

- Visualize and consult the design patterns on Storybook page
- Use a login page with a solid design pattern

<br>

## 🎯 Learning goals

Learn how the component based React technology works and how to make documentation with Storybook.

<br>

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was built using following technologies:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Storybook
- Figma

<br>

## 💻 Project

### A figma project was created to define the design system default components.

![Figma components layer](./design/figma-components-layer.png)

### Then the Storybook was configured to document all design system components.

<br>

## 🌎 Deploy
Storybook: [tascintra.github.io/design-system-lab](https://tascintra.github.io/design-system-lab)
<br>
React Application: [design-system-lab-tascintra.vercel.app](https://design-system-lab-tascintra.vercel.app)

<br>

## ✔️ I learned

How componentization works in React, how to use Tailwind CSS to make style work more productive, how to make and deploy project documentation with Storybook and how to run tests using an environment with Axios.

<br>

## 👨‍💻 Continued development

Now next goal is to improve my JavaScript skills so I can go deeper learning React.
